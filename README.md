🌐 CNET Cisco Packet Tracer Project
A comprehensive network design and simulation project built using Cisco Packet Tracer as part of the Computer Networks (CNET) course. This project demonstrates the practical application of core networking concepts through a realistic, layered network architecture.

🔧 Features
🖧 Layered Network Design
Includes Core, Distribution, and Access Layers following standard enterprise network architecture.

📶 VLAN Configuration
VLANs implemented to segment network traffic and improve security and performance.

🛡️ Inter-VLAN Routing
Configured using Router-on-a-Stick or Layer 3 Switch for communication across VLANs.

🔐 DHCP, DNS, and NAT Setup
Simulated internal services for dynamic IP assignment and external network access.

📊 Static & Dynamic Routing
Includes RIP, OSPF, or EIGRP protocols to demonstrate routing behavior.

📡 Wireless Integration
Wi-Fi network setup using access points and wireless clients.

🧪 End-to-End Testing
Full testing of network functionality including pings, traceroutes, and service reachability.
